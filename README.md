# Kindle Book Notes (HTML) to Markdown Converter

I often save notes (highlights) from my Kindle book reading, but want to save the as markdown. So, I created a simple utility to convert saved notes from Kindle books (HTML) to markdown.

## Notes
* By default, book notes exported from Kindle (app or device) are in HTML format. The headings (page number references) are contained in the `noteHeading` class.
* The notes themselves are contained in the `noteText` class. This is the text I want to pull out and save.
